### License
MSGD is released under a [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/chaogao-cam/MSGD/blob/master/COPYING.txt). For all the third-party code/libraries included/extended/linked by MSGD, please see [Dependencies.md](https://github.com/chaogao-cam/MSGD/blob/master/Dependencies.md).

### Prerequisites
MSGD has been tested in **OS X El Capitan** and **macOS Sierra**. 

### Datasets and Groundtruth
All datasets and groundtruth files are in the folder *datasets* (g2o format). For WGB2a-1, WGB2a-2, WGB2a-3 and WGB2a-4, the Bat Ultrasonic Location System (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/bat/) was used to provide high-accuracy groundtruth. For other datasets, the groundtruths were obtained by manual labelling etc., so the accuracy is relatively low.

### Build and Run
```
git clone https://github.com/chaogao-cam/MSGD.git MSGD
cd MSGD
make all
./msgd -in ./datasets/input_g2o_file_name.g2o -out result_folder_path
```
